## Files

The project consists of three files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the 404 error page.
2. `styles.css`: The CSS styles for the error page, including the animation effect.
3. `script.js`: The JavaScript code for the "Go Back" button functionality.

## Usage

To use this custom 404 error page, simply add the provided files to your project folder and configure your server to display the `index.html` file when a 404 error occurs.

### index.html

The `index.html` file contains the main structure of the 404 error page. It includes a link to the `styles.css` file for styling and a script reference to the `script.js` file for the "Go Back" button functionality.

### styles.css

The `styles.css` file contains all the necessary CSS styles for the 404 error page. It includes the animation effect for the "404" text, as well as general styling for the page layout, colors, and the "Go Back" button.

### script.js

The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the "Go Back" button functionality. The script listens for a click event on the button and navigates the browser back to the previous page in the browser's history.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the error page by modifying the styles in the `styles.css` file. Additionally, you can change the text content in the `index.html` file to better fit your project's branding and language requirements.
